# Battleship

## Description

# Battleship

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the Battleship game, built to practice DOM manipulation and core game logic. It is part of the coding portfolio of Adrian Ferrero Asensio. The game is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and mirrors the classic Battleship board game by Hasbro. Users can place five ships randomly on their game board with the goal of sinking all of the computer’s ships.

## Motivation

The Battleship project is part of my self-taught education through The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course. The goal of this project was to practice Test-Driven Development using Jest, as well as object-oriented programming with the use of JavaScript classes.

git clone git@github.com:Afer1991/battleship.git
