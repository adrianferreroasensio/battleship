# Battleship

## Description

Battleship game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game mirrors the Battleship Hasbro game. Users can place 5 ships randomly on their game board with the goal of sinking all of the computer's ships.

## Motivation

The Battleship project is part of my self-taught education through The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course. The goal of this project was to practice Test-Driven Development using Jest, as well as object-oriented programming with the use of JavaScript classes.

## Quick Start

git clone git@github.com:Afer1991/battleship.git
```
```
cd battleship
```

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
